## Foldable!

The cheatsheet is designed to be foldable in half for easy carrying. Print it out onto a standard 8.5" x 11" piece of paper (I usually print out the PDF). Then simply fold down horizontally. The content should neatly fall on both sides.

## How to Contribute

Like what you see and want to contribute? Know of a poetic form that's not included here? Let me know about it!

I made this with Adobe Fireworks which is the best program. Unfortunately Adobe has announced that it was phasing it out in 2013. The PNG file is in Fireworks format, but if you can read it (as in the layer data and all that), then feel free to change it and send me a pull request. Or if not, just open up an issue and I'll see what I can do.
